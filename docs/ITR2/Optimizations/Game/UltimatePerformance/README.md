- Carefully copy all the settings in the image to your settings—don’t miss a thing!

### Additional Tips

- **Upscaling Preferences:**  
  If you want to squeeze extra FPS through upscaling, keep it between **70% and 100%**.  
  The same applies to sharpening—don't go below 70%, and not higher than 100%.
